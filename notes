// from the moment the request is made, to the moment
// we set it up on their desk and do our final checks.
// You can begin the process on your desktop, pick up where
// you left off on your phone, or other device, anyone in
// our team can pickup an in progress deploy, or just see
// where a given deploy is in the process.
// Once the deploy is done, you'll tap or click Finished,
// everything will validate, and then send the appropriate
// asset numbers to Susan and close the ESR.

// Josh Sarrett has goals that align with this, and says
// he can get me access to the API.

// This will give us extremely consistent experiences for
// our clients, and ensure we track all our hardware even
// better than we have in the past, as well as making an end
// of "what's the status of these laptops all over the room?"

// Version 1 of this was a paper form that we attached to the 
// computers, and techs have attested to the value it adds,
// eleviating ambiguity.
